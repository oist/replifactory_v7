      This experiment involves the machine continuously measuring
      the optical density in selected reactors every cycle. The optical density
      is a critical parameter indicating the growth rate and concentration of
      microorganisms in the reactors. By monitoring these measurements,
      researchers can gain insights into the biological processes occurring
      within each reactor.

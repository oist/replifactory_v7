        Objective: To maintain a microbial culture at a constant OD by applying
        infinite dilution techniques, ensuring the culture remains in the
        exponential growth phase
      </p>
      <p>
        Background: Optical density at 600 nm (OD600) is a common measure of
        bacterial culture density. It reflects the light scattering by the
        bacteria in the culture. The OD600 value is used to estimate the cell
        concentration and to maintain the culture in the desired growth phase1.
      </p>
      <p>Method:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Preparation:</b> Begin with a microbial culture at a known OD, which
          is within the linear range of the spectrophotometer used for OD
          measurements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cycling Process:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Measure OD:</b> At regular intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes),
              measure the OD of the culture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Dilution:</b> If the OD exceeds the target value, dilute the
              culture with fresh medium to bring it back to the desired OD.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Inoculation:</b> After dilution, inoculate the culture into a new
              vessel to continue growth.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Monitoring:</b> Continuously monitor the OD to ensure it stays within
          the target range, indicating the culture is in the log phase of growth.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Considerations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Dilution Factor:</b> The dilution factor depends on the initial and
          target OD values. It should be calculated to ensure the culture is
          brought back to the target OD after each cycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Growth Phase:</b> Maintaining the culture at a specific OD helps keep
          it in the exponential (log) phase, which is ideal for many types of
          experiments, such as protein expression2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Conclusion: This experiment allows for the continuous cultivation of a
        microbial culture at a controlled OD, facilitating studies that require
        the culture to remain in a specific growth phase.
